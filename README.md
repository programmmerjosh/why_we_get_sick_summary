## Chapter 14: Get Moving — The Importance of Physical Activity

### The Function of Insulin in the Body
- Insulin helps escort glucose from the blood into tissues like the brain, heart, muscles, and fat.
- This process is essential to normalize blood glucose levels.

### How Physical Activity Helps
- **Muscle contraction removes glucose from the blood independently of insulin.**
- Therefore, movement lowers blood insulin levels during and after exercise.

### Common Misconceptions
- **Myth:** Muscles only use glucose for energy.
- **Fact:** Muscles can also use fat and ketones for energy.

### Exercise Recommendations
- **Combine resistance and aerobic training** for maximum benefit.
- Resistance training, even **twice weekly**, can improve insulin sensitivity.
- **Higher intensity** training leads to greater benefits.
- Avoid sugary foods and drinks **after workouts** to preserve insulin sensitivity gains.
- As fitness improves, the body uses **more fat at higher intensities**.
- **Frequency matters less** than training to failure.
- Regularly **increase frequency or intensity** for ongoing benefit.

### Additional Tip
- **Cold exposure** can help regulate insulin levels.

## Chapter 15: Eat Smart — The Evidence on Food

### Caloric Restriction Caveat
- Restricting calories can cause **insulin resistance**.
- Calorie restriction lowers **thyroid hormones**, worsening insulin resistance.

### Smart Eating Practices
- Eat **starchy foods at the end** of meals to lessen insulin spikes.
- **Soluble fiber** (from fruits and select vegetables) is especially beneficial.

### Fasting Benefits
- Monthly **24-hour fasts** cut insulin resistance risk in half.
- **Glucagon rises** during fasting, promoting energy usage.
- **Insulin stores** energy, while **glucagon spends** it.

### Timing Matters
- Breakfast content impacts insulin more than any other meal.
- Skipping breakfast may help with insulin resistance.
- **Fat tissue is more insulin-sensitive in the morning.**

### Carbohydrate and Fat Insights

#### Carbohydrate Quality
- Not all carbs are equal — focus on **glycemic load (GL)**, not glycemic index (GI).
- A **low GL** means a more favorable insulin response.

#### Fat Quality
- **Animal fats** contain a mix of saturated, mono-, and poly-unsaturated fats.
- Replacing saturated fats with **industrial polyunsaturated oils** (like soybean or corn oil) can be harmful.
- **Flaxseed oil (ALA)** improves insulin sensitivity.

## Low-Carb, High-Fat & Ketogenic Diets

### Key Effects
- Improve **oxidative stress**, **inflammation**, and **insulin sensitivity**.
- Ketones act as powerful **antioxidants** and **anti-inflammatories**.
- Promote **mitochondrial health** in muscle and beta cells.

### Understanding Ketosis
- Ketosis occurs when **insulin is low**, and the liver produces **ketones** from fat.
- **Ketones don't need insulin**, making them brain- and metabolism-friendly.
- They also **activate brown fat** and promote fat burning.

### Health Benefits
- Lower **blood pressure**, triglycerides, and raise HDL cholesterol.
- Improve **reproductive health** in women and **testosterone** in men.
- May improve **cognitive function** in Alzheimer's patients.
- Help reduce or eliminate **migraines** and **heartburn**.

## Longevity Connection
- Families that live the longest tend to be **most insulin sensitive**.
